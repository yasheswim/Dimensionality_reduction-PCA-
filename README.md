# Dimensionality_reduction-PCA-
Perform dimensionality reduction to reduce the variance among the independent features and subsequently reduce overfitting of the training data
Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first 3 principal component scores (both heirarchial and k mean clustering(scree plot or elbow curve) and 
obtain optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters with the original data.
